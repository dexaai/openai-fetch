# OpenAI Fetch Client

[![Build Status](https://github.com/rileytomasek/openai-fetch/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rileytomasek/openai-fetch/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai-fetch.svg?color=0c0)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai-fetch)

A minimal and opinionated OpenAI client powered by fetch.

Unfortunately, the official [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) package patches fetch in problematic ways and is quite bloated.

### Reasons to consider using `openai-fetch`:

- You want a fast and small client that doesn't patch fetch
- Supports all envs with native fetch: Node 18+, browsers, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, etc
- Package size: `openai-fetch` is [~14kb](https://bundlephobia.com/package/openai-fetch) and `openai` is [~142kb](https://bundlephobia.com/package/openai)
- You only need chat, completions, embeddings, and moderations

### Use the official `openai` package if:

- Your runtime doesn't have native fetch support
- Your app can't handle native ESM code
- You need endpoints other than chat, completions, embeddings, and moderations
- You aren't concerned with lib size or fetch patching

## Install

```bash
npm install openai-fetch
```

This package requires `node >= 18` or an environment with `fetch` support.

This package exports [ESM](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). If your project uses CommonJS, consider switching to ESM or use the [dynamic `import()`](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import) function.

## Usage

```ts
import { OpenAIClient } from 'openai-fetch';

const client = new OpenAIClient({ apiKey: '<your api key>' });
```

The `apiKey` is optional and will be read from `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` if present.

## API

The API follows OpenAI very closely, so their [reference documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference) can generally be used. Everything is strongly typed, so you will know if anything is different as soon as TypeScript parses your code.

```ts
// Generate a single chat completion
client.createChatCompletion(params: ChatParams): Promise<ChatResponse>;

// Stream a single completion via a ReadableStream
client.streamChatCompletion(params: ChatStreamParams): Promise<ChatStreamResponse>;

// Generate one or more completions
client.createCompletions(params: CompletionParams): Promise<CompletionResponse>;

// Stream a single completion via a ReadableStream
client.streamCompletion(params: CompletionStreamParams): Promise<CompletionStreamResponse>;

// Generate one or more embeddings
client.createEmbeddings(params: EmbeddingParams): Promise<EmbeddingResponse>

// Checks for potentially harmful content
client.createModeration(params: ModerationParams): Promise<ModerationResponse>
```

### Type Definitions

The type definitions are avaible through TSServer, and can be found here: [type definitions](/src/types.ts).
